## Timing of development

💔 Rather extremely long, could take as long as 2024. Although we and I need to hurry, and do it as fast as we can. The contract is actually up to two years. So I would really like to find maintainers, partners, workers, developers, up to 5 people. At this point, I have to and do act alone. Given our situation, we have to act solely on pure enthusiasm, as well as for the sake of the portfolio. It's just that I need something to answer to God in the afterlife. 💔
